#Pumpkin Hacking

The event will be an all-day event, split into two sections, a family aimed event in the afternoon, and a more adult oriented event in the evening.

The idea will be to 'hack' pumpkins in both a figurative and literal sense, encouraging artistic endeavours as well as technical skill and innovation. We will be providing tools and equipment to work on the pumpkins, as well as hopefully pumpkins for those who pre-book.

We also hope to provide the following:

* Snacks and drinks via snackspace
* Hotdogs
* BUGS! kits
* A selection of Scrapstore bits in exchange for donations to the Scrapstore (donation jar)
* Guidance, encouragement, and an area to let imagination go wild
* Prizes donated from different local/tech companies

This event should bring in money for the hackspace through - 

* Hotdog sales
* Snacks and drinks sales
* Sale of BUGS! kits
* Entry fee per pumpkin entered (collected on entry, and per extra pumpkin entered)

This event should also bring the space new visitors and publicity, as we will be looking to notify local news organisations about the event, and encourage some smaller organisations participation in the evening event.
