#Costings

All costings are based on *buying equipment* that we don't have, and the budget will drop depending on what we can borrow, or get donated.

* Buckets - £1.50 each, x2 - £3.50
* HARRIS TASKMASTERS POLYTHENE DUST SHEET ROLL 50M X 2M - £7

##Extra tools

These will likely be used again in the space, so they aren't purely for the event - furthermore, I hope to run this event again in the future.
