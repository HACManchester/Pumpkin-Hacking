Point scoring will be seperate for the single hackspace level and the national level judging, to allow for clear scoring on both an individual hackspace level and a national level (so we don't get the equivilent of three 9.9 scores in the national judging). Point scoring will also be similarly seperate at Family and L33T HAX0R levels of the competition.

Points for:
Carving techniques - 0-10 points
	Pumpkin carving is full of different techniques, from basic knife carving to layered shading of the light coming from the pumpkin, surface detail, or even entirely deconstructing the pumpkin and creating somthing entirely new from its flesh - such as an entire skeliton in carved bones from a series of pumpkins. This score will be based on the contestants and their pumpkins in the space, so the full range of 0-10 cann be used.

Innovation - 0-10 points
Tech integration - 0-5 points
Artistic skill - 0-10 points
Best use of your pumpkin - 0-15 points
