#Rules

1. All carving must be done at the time of the event, in the designated space.
2. Entry fee is per pumpkin entered - entry of more than one per person is encouraged
3. Power tools are free to be used, as long as:
	..* the use is safe 
	..* the user is trained
	..* the tools are cleaned correctly afterwards by the user.
	..* the use is approved by a volunteer
4. Please minimise mess as much as possible, and use designated messy areas if you decide to go full 'Dexter' on the pumpkin. Flinging pumpkin at the ceiling with intent is reason for ejection from the competition and the space.
5. Feel free to add to the pumpkin and bring materials to do so, from electronics to fabrics and more.
6. A pumpkin made during the family period can be entered into the L33T HAX0R competition, but not vice-versa, and not both.
7. Family enterants must include at least one child within their group, up to the age of 16.
8. Pumpkins will be videoed for judging, and photographed, and a short statement about the pumpkin can be made via video or a short written piece if desired. Judging will then take place at the end of the crafting period, however enterants are free to take their pumpkins home once they have been recorded.

##Points

Point scoring will be separate for the single hackspace level and the national level judging, to allow for clear scoring on both an individual hackspace level and a national level (so we don't get the equivalent of three 9.9 scores in the national judging). Point scoring will also be similarly separate at Family and L33T HAX0R levels of the competition.

###Points for:
* Carving techniques - 0-10 points
	Pumpkin carving is full of different techniques, from basic knife carving to layered shading of the light coming from the pumpkin, surface detail, or even entirely deconstructing the pumpkin and creating something entirely new from its flesh - such as an entire skeleton in carved bones from a series of pumpkins. This score will be based on the contestants and their pumpkins in the space, so the full range of 0-10 can be used.

* Innovation - 0-10 points
	Is your pumpkin sporting a radical new carving method? Maybe the addition of a technique, material, or something else entirely makes your pumpkin stand out from the crowd? This is where YOU can score points!
	
* Tech integration - 0-5 points
	Pumpkins with flashing lights, or that float above terrified Trick or Treaters? That's the kind of fright we're into.
	
* Scare Factor - 0-5 points
	It's Halloween, right?
	
* Artistic skill - 0-10 points
	Just cutting a basic face in and sticking in some blinking lights... No, this is an area for a true pumpkin artisan, a carver of talent and dedication to the art-form. One who can create shade and light, balance, and *movement* in the piece!

* Best use of your pumpkin - 0-10 points
	Pumpkins come in all shapes and sizes - taking inspiration from your gourd and figuring out how best to use it, rather than making a plan and then applying it to any pumpkin, is a skill in its self. Look into your pumpkin, become one with your pumpkin. Then carve its flesh.

##Prizes

###Main Prizes 

There will be a first prize, and a runner up - these will hopefully be sponsored prizes.

###Special Prizes

Special prizes are categories that *may* be given out, and are not categories to explicitly aim for in the main.

Special prizes for:
Most crazy
	Kinda up to the judges on the day, don't you think?
Biggest failure
	This cannot have been in any way intentional. As long as it may have been possible in the time frame, the tools and equipment was available, and a reasonable effort was made, a total failure may not be a total loss. But it must be an impressive failure in some way.
Ambition
	Even if the project fell short, or missed its goal, a good shot into orbit is deserving of commendation even if it missed the moon. 
Most scary
	It's fear Jim, but not as we know it! Crazy pumpkins, pumpkins that strike fear into the hearts of teachers everywhere, or even into parents! This can be anything from conventional horror to somthing all together different.
